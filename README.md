# Trustlines Monitor DAppNode Package

The Trustlines monitor watches the blockchain and makes sure that validators are online and behave correctly. Every node in the network should run it and users should regularly check for reports of misbehaving validators.

## Trustlines

The [Trustlines Protocol](https://trustlines.network/) aims to provide the service of “transfer of value” without actually transferring value. This can be accomplished by leveraging networks of mutual-trust. The [Trustlines Protocol](https://trustlines.network/) is being built to support a range of use cases by leveraging existing networks of mutual trust and mapping trust-based relationships onto trustless infrastructure.

The official documentation of [Trustlines Network](https://trustlines.network/) can be found [here](https://docs.trustlines.network/)
